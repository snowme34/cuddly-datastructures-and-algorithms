# Cuddly Data Structures and Algorithms

Some naive and cuddly data structures and algorithms.

Write **for fun only**.

## Algorithms

* MatrixRotate

  A simple algorithm that can rotate a square matrix (n*n) in O(n^2) time with constant memory space.

* Depth First Search (DFS) in 2D array in c++

  It's unexpectedly hard to find clean implementation of dfs for 2d array in c++ online. So I wrote one.

## Data Structures

* Linked List
* Binary Tree
